Why not to stop fapping at all? 

The goal of this guide is to make a healthy attitude towards fapping.

Excessive fapping is unhealthy. I believe that no fapping at all is also unhealthy. If you can't keep
yourself from fapping in 2 days and it ruins your relationship or live - you
have a problem. If you don't fap at all because you know that as soon as you
start it you get into a long binge of fapping - you have a problem too. In both
of those cases you can't control your fapping desires. In last example you may
not realize that, but believe me, those who can abscent from fapping for a long
time but can easily fall into a binge also can't control their desire.

My model of healthy fapping is this: you can live a life where you are keeping
your sexual desires towards fapping and porn and so on. You don't do it when you
don't have desire for it, time for it, place for it, etc. You don't do it when
you simply realise that right now it will hinder your goals. You may have a
tough project at your work and you have to put all your efforts towards this and
you simply can't spend the whole your day at an office dreaming of naked girls. Or your
girl friend needs your attention in bed and you know if you will masturbate you
will have not enough sexual energy for her in the end of the day. 

But at some days you feel that you have free time for it, you have free space
for it, you don't have to keep your sexual energy on your SO because he/she is
far away from you right now, and what is more important, you feel like you just
want to have sex, and you will enjoy it fully. Then, I believe, that is a good
time to fap. And, the most important thing, after your fapping session you will
easily return to your normal life without long binges that slowly ruins your life.

I can live in this helthy fapping mode for two last years now. I believe that I
found a system that works for me pretty well. I understand that this system may
not work for everyone, but I still believe that It will work for most of people.
