title: "Modes Of Fapping Habbit"
---

I start with oversimplified model. 

The most valuable variable is your sexual desire right now. It can vary during
the day, the week and even month. It depends on lots of factors, such as your
testosterone level, how long you haven't had sex etc. But ussualy it goes like
this: first you don't desire sex, then you desire increases, then you feel like
you can't stand it anymore, than you have sex or masturbate, and your desire
decreasas. And you sexual desire continuously goes up and down during the whole
your lifetime.

Alongside with your sexual desire is your urge to fap. With increasing of a
sexual desire your urge to fap is inreasing too.

Let's see on a moment where you have high sexual desire, and high urge to fap.
You have three options here:

1. Fap and decrease your sexual desire.
2. Have sex and decrease your sexual desire.
3. Just ingore the urge and desire.

The first one is usually the simplest one. If you don't have a SO the second
option may be very difficalt, because you have to spend time to find a girl.
But even you have a girl to fap is still much easier, and a lot of guys prefear
1st options when they are in relationship.

The thrid option may be difficult. May be near impossible if you have problems
with controling our fapping habbit (which you certanately do if you read this).
But it also may be easy. I will show you some techniques that I use to make it
easy, but that's later.

But you may also fap even if you don't have sexual desire. Usually when you have
some stress in your life to quickly release it you may find yourself fapping.

I would also to go as far as to say that you can have high sexual desire and
almost no urge to fap. That's why it calls a habbit.

       UF
       ^
       |
  4    |   3
       |
-------+--------> SD
       |
  1    |   2
       |


So, usually, you are hovering betwen 1 and 3 (almost without reaching 2). 
But some may hover betwen 1 and 2, and in a worst case peple may be hovering
between 4 and 3.

       UF
       ^
       |
       |
       |
-------+--------> SD
       |
 <###########>
       |

People who constantly have low urge to fap regardless their sexual desire level
are people who just don't have such habbit as fapping. They are obviously
beyound the scope of this guide. I don't consider them to have unhealthy
attitude towards fapping though.


       UF
       ^
   ^   |
   #   |
   #   |
---#---+-------> SD
   #   |
   #   |   alien mode
   v   |


       UF
       ^
       |
 <###########>
       |
-------+--------> SD
       |
       |  freak mode
       |

People who are constatnly there are the worst case scenario. The may fap for
several times a day. The are clearly have unhealthy addiction.

       UF
       ^
       |  ##
       | ##
       |##
-------#--------> SD
     ##|
    ## |    default mode
  ##   |


And those who find themselfs on this diagram may be or may not be
masturbation addicts. It depends on wheter they can or can't intentionaly resist
the urge to fap. In any case, I believe that having positive correlation between
your UF and SD is a default mode for the most of men.

So you are somewhere between freak and default modes. 
If you are in freak mode
I almost sure you have unhealthy fap habbit. If you are in default mode you may
not have unhealthy fap habbit if you can intentionaly resist your urges.

What do to if you are in a freak mode? I will talk about that in a special part
of this guide. But the most of the guid  will be about default mode.
