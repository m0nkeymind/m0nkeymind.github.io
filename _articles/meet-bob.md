It is Bob. He is male. He has problems with fapping habbit.
He is at his office now. And he had some things to do
now. He has very important project to finish today. And he kept himself away
from fapping for 5 days now. And ne has very strong motivation today to finish
the project and not to masturbate.

Now let's see on anchors that are around him and to wich his attention will
focus his mind. 

The main anchor is his work. He know he must to do it and he will do his best to
keep his mind focused on that anchor. Fb - is the anchor that will make him
check his messages on the facebook. He may also want to chek latest news. He may
notice some advertisment on the side of the page. Somewhere on the Internet his
eyes may catch some nice picture of a pretty girl. His attention may also be
switched off his work by thought of his unpained mortgage, or by some memmory
form his childhood (good or bad). He may also switch his attention to hear a
bird signing on the outside of his building. Or he may became consious of some
discomort caused by his uncomfortable armchair.

The most dangerous anchors of his mind is porn which will inevitabely lead to
fapping.

Of course real number of anchor for Bob's mind around him is much much more. But
for the sake of simplisity we will see only those few anchors.

What Bob realy want today is his mind to stay on the "work" anchor with rare
ocasional switches to "fb" or "news" anchors followed by return to "work".
Something like that:

work -> work -> work -> fb -> work -> work -> work -> news -> work -> work

The thing is, this won't happens. No matter how much will Bob wants that, his
monkey in the mind will switch anchors how monkey, not Bob, wants it.
And the sequenses of anchor may be like that.

work -> fb -> ad -> mem -> mort -> work -> work -> news -> fb -> work -> work

No one can predict exact consequence of switches. And the main problem lies
here. We can't be sure that somehow the conseques of anchors switches won't
reach "porn" and than "fap". And Bob know that regardless of his own strong
intention to spend today's hours in the office working he may in fact start
fapping to realize that he done nothing oh his project in the end of the day.

#### Diffrenet Links To Anchors.

There is non-zero possibility to go to any anchor form any other. In other
words, ther are links between each pair of anchors. But every link has it's own
probability. The probability that Bob's mind jump from "work" to "fap" is
relatevily low. Probability that his mind jump from "porn" to "fap" is
significantly higher regardless of Bob's motivation to work. You can look on
this netwrok of links as on Markov's chain with each link has it's own weight.

The weight of each link depends on many factors. Our whises to stay on "work",
to kepp away from "fap" and "porn" changes corresponded weights. Our mood today
can change some weights. Our hormonal level may change some of them.

Among all factor the most valuable factor is UF level. While our wishes to keep
away from fapping slightly lowers correstponding weightes UF level significanely
increases them.

Right now Bob is in this situation. He's motivation lowers "work" -> "fap" and
"work" -> "porn" links. But he's high UF level increases "porn" -> "fap",
"girl pic" -> "porn" links and all links that lead to "girl pic" anchor.
( Keep in mind that it is just simplified version of what will happen in reality.
It is not a verbatim scenario.)

Now when Bob is trying to focus on his work the monkey in his mind will change
focus of his mind to anchors that are closely linked to work anchor. Odds that
he will leap to fap is low, but odds that he eventualy appears on "girl pic" is
high due to his high level of UF. Now when Bobs monkey focuses his mind on "girl
pic" chances are he will jump to "porn" and then to "fap".

#### What Can Bob Do?

Earlier we said that Bob can't keep his mind focused on "work" or any other
anchor no matter how motivated will he be. Monkey in his mind is in charge of
keeping attention of mind on an anchor. Bob's monkey is also in charge of
switching attention from anchor to anchor.

But what we havent't said earlier is that in fact Bob also can switch his attention
from anchor to anchors. But to do this he has to realize that he need this. It
requires some mental efforts. And to save our limited mental resourses our brain
is usually keep as away from that realization. If Bob "awakes" while staing on a
wrong anchor he is able to switch to any anchor he likes. The next moment he
will almost inevitiably loose this realization or "awakaned" state and his mind
will keep and switch anchors again.

|                |  Bob      | His monkey |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Keep attention |  Never    | Always     |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Switch anchor  | Sometimes | Always     |

I will say it again: Bob can't intentionaly keep staying on a "work" anchor.
Bob's monkey will stay on whatever anchor it's like for whatever period of times it
wants. Bob's monkey will also leaps from anchor to anchor. And while his UF
level is high chances are monkey will eventual leap to "girl pic" to appear on
"fap" in the end.

If being on an anchor other that "work" Bob realise that he's not working
anymore he may intentionally leap back to "work". Inevitebaly his monkey will
leap back to whater anchor it's like Bob is in danger of fapping again.

According to weights of links Bob's monkey will move closer and closer to "fap"
again and again. And if Bob want to stay away from it he need to "awake" and
leap on "work" again and again. And that is really challanging.

##### So what can be done here?

* Remove "fap", "porn" (and other simillar anchors) complitely. Delete all porn
  from hard drive. Cut off internet connection. Don't stay alone in a room.

* Temporally change weights that lead to fap. Monkey will not (or to be precise, probably
  will not) leap on chains that leads to "fap". Still it will distract Bob from
  work and will lead him to other anchors though.

* Awake again and again when the monkey leaps on chains that leads to "fap" and
  then intentionaly leap back to "work".

While first option is the most strict and the most working one in theory, it is
ussualy imposible. You have to remove those anchors physicaly. For the reasons
mentioned earlier it is not enough to mentaly remove them from your mind. Sadly,
you can't stay away from Internet for too long. You can't
always be amoung friend who will keep your from fapping.
You always vulnerable to fap when thouse anchors appears near you.
But as a temporal measure it work pretty well though. 

What I found works for me, and what will work for Bob and what will probably
work for you is combination of 2nd and 3rd options. But if you can use 1st
option somehow, feel free to use it too in combination with 2nd and 3rd.

##### The Role of UF

As we said, with increasing of UF weights of corresponing links are also
increasing.
