title: "Alghorithm of training the monkey"
---

One goal of this algorithm is to train yourself to constantly "awake" when your
mind is on a dangerous anchor. Another goal is to train your monkey to keep away
from dangerous anchors, i.e. lower weights of correspondin links.

As soon as you feel increasing of your UF level immidiately do **penalty exercise**.

Two questions should arise now: how to feel increasing of your UF level and what
the heck is *penalty exercise*?

#### How to feel increase of UF level?

It is simple when you know it. Ussualy it goes alongside with subtle increasing
of heart rate and changing of breathing pattern. But the best way to feel it is
to learn that feeling inside you that makes you one step forward the thought "Why
not to touch my penis?". That subtle sticky itchy feeling somewhere on the
background of you. I'm sure you are familiar with it.

Good way to learn that feeling is to intentionaly increase your UF carefuly
listening to your body. Sit in front of your monitor with a blank page on it. Do
a few deep breathes and spend a minute just sitting and relaxing. Try to listen
to your body. Try to recognise feelings inside it. Promise yourself that you
won't fap now whatever will happens. It will a little (very little) prepare your
monkey for the next. Just in case.

Then go to your favorite web-site that usually leads you to fap. Don't surf
through it. Just load a single page. You will shut it in 10 seconds. Before you
shut it sit and watch it and carefuly listen to your body. Try to recognase
increasing of desires to fap. It woun't increase much in first seconds. Chances
are it will go from, say 2 to 2.5, or 3, maybe even to 4, but not to 6.

Now shut the fucking page and go do **penalty exercise**.

#### What the heck is penalty exercise?

It is a physical exercise that cause you discomfort. It is a way to punish your
monkey to hit dangerous leverages in your mind. You may be in different
environments when you feel increasing of UF and different situations requres
different PE but ideal PE should:

* Be physical. It means that you have to move your body, not try to solve
  mathematical problems in your head even if it causes you discomfort.

* Change your heart rate and breath pattern. This will lead to oxygen and blood
  intake in your brain to help you fully "awake" in a moment.

* Be uncomortable. You should almost hate doing that but still able to manage to
  do it constantly during the day. On some days you will have to do it 100
  times or even more.

I would even go as far as to say that chosing correct PE for your current
environment will do 80% of success.

As an example of a good PE that I know is: 5 push ups on a floor in a row.
It is physical, it changes your heart rate and breath pattern, and believe me
you'll hate it when you need to do it each (EACH!) time you feel UF increase.
Each time you feel it you have to stand up from your cozy armchair at you desk,
lay on a floor and push yourself up 5 times. On some days you'll have to do this
around 100 times. Your monkey will hate the day you read this guide!

Sadly, push up is not the best PE. I'm affraid there is no best PE (I still
hope it though). I bet it is to embarrasing for you to do this exersice when you
are on a street, or in the shop.

#### How much UF increase should I feel to do penalty exercise?

Any little increase that you're able to notice. You have to do this each time
you notice it. With time you will be very very good at noticing this moment.
Each time your UF will increase your monkey in the mind will ring the bell and
prey you not to punish her. Ignore it and do a PE. Each fucking time.

The real problem is with falling asleap at the evenings on a days when your mind
is not trained yet. You are laying in your cozy bed. You mind is relaxing and
pleasantly wanders in a dreamy state from thought to thought. And it eventualy
arises at a thought wich increases your UF. Remember, it is not necessary a thought of a
beautiful girl that you don't mind to fuck. It may be recollection of a plesent
place in the past that for some strange reason slightly increases UF from 2.2 to
2.3. Slighlty, but still noticably. Stand up and do PE. Yes, I know you want to
stay in your cozy bed in your sleapy state. You'll sleep tomorrow. Now stand up
and do PE. Then lay back, and try to fall asleep. Notice UF increase and stand
up and do PE. In an hour you'll be exhausted of this torture. Ussualy in a few
days you are able to keep your UF under a control and you will notice how your
UF increases more rare with each day from 100 to 0.

#### Will this ever work?

I won't lie to you. This doesn't work if you:

* Miss the moment of UF increasing.
* Notice the moment, but don't do **penalty exercise** because:
    + You're uncomfortable/embarrased to do it immidiately.
    + You feel like you keep everything under control and this moment won't lead to fap.

As soon as I found that keeping an eye on my UF level allows me to stop my
fapping I haven't had much of a problem with missing the moment of UF
increasing. I believe it is not that hard and so it is not a real problem.

Real challenge are two last problems.

If you can eliminate those three problems read my lips then: This. Method. Will. Work. Period.
