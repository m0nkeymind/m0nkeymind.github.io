title: "Alghorithm of training the monkey"
---

One goal of this algorithm is to train yourself to constantly "awake" when your
mind is on a dangerous anchor. Another goal is to train your monkey to keep away
from dangerous anchors, i.e. lower weights of correspondin links.

As soon as you feel increasing of your UF level immidiately do **penalty exercise**.

Two questions should arise now: how to feel increasing of your UF level and what
the heck is *penalty exercise*?


#### Will this ever work?

I won't lie to you. This doesn't work if you:

* Miss the moment of UF incresing.
* Notice the moment, but don't do **penalty exercise** becuase:
    + You're uncomfortable/embarrased to do it immidiately.
    + You feel like you keep everything under control and this moment won't lead to fap.
