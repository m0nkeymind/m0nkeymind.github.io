title: "Stages of Default Mode"
---


Now let's see closely on default mode and it's stages. As UF and SD are
positevely correlated in this mode we can get rid of sexual desire for a moment
and keep only one variable - UF.

UF

|                       *    *   *   *   *   *          *                                  *        *
|                     **      * *    *  * * *           *              *              *   *         *
|                   **         *      **   *            *         *   * *            * * *          *
|          ***     *                                    *        * * *   *   ****   *   *           *      *
|    *    *   * * *                                     ****    *   *     * *    * *                *     * *
|  ** ** *     * *                                         *   *           *      *                 *    *   *
|**     *                                                   ***                                     *****

This is a typical plot of my UF during two days. My UF increases from Low to
High. The & mark is my fapping. After fapping I have decrease of my UF followed
by its eventual increase.

Notice the pattern of the plot. UF arbuptly drops after an orgasm. And it varys
in a broad range during the day.  It can goes up, then goes down, then goes up
again.  It even may be so high that I feel almost unresistable urge to fap.
If I manage to resist it it will eventually goes down.

But when I start fapping it freezes on the constant level.

Now, I believe that you almost have no control over your UF. It is not your
intentional choice to have high or low UF. In default mode It is closely related
to your SD and contol of that is beyound your abbilities.

##### Monkey mind model

Before we move next it is useful to introduce model of monkey mind.
It is used by buddhists when they talk about ones innabilietes to control their
own mind.

We can think of our mind as of a cabin with a dashboard with lots of leverages.
Each of which is using to contol some behaviour of our body. If we touch one
leverage our arm will move, if we touch another leverage our mouth will speak
somethig. And there is a monkey in this cabin. And it touches those leverages.
And people usually can't control monkey inside their mind. Most of the time the
monkey touches right leverages, and we walk, sit, do some meaningful actions.
But if monkey desides to touch wrong leverage (i.e. the one, that will cause us
to chek facebook messages instead of working of our urgent project at work) it
will touche it regardless of our intention not to touch.

Now, there is a leverage in our mind that will cause our hand to grab our penis
and to start fapping. And our monkey likes to touch that leverage. And when we
have strong intention not to fap and sit and work on a projet instead but our UF
is too high then our monkey will touch the leverage.

Countless times I was working to my office in the morning with the strong
intention to spend this day in a productive work. But few hours later I was
sitting at my desk and fapping. Why does it happens? Because monkey in our mind
have zero fucks towards our intentions. It does only what it likes to do.

What to do then? Well, instead of deside  not to fap, train your monkey not to
touch the fapping leverage in your mind. If you have a dog and it piss on your
floor in a house you have to train it not to do that. Imagin yourself in such
situation with a dog that constntly pees on your floor. And you decide that you
god will not pee on your floor anymore. Will it work? Of course not! 

Don't deside to stop fapping. Traing your monkey mind to stop touching that leverage.

##### Role of anchors in default mode

Imagine yourself sitting in the morning at your notebook checking news. You want
to keep yourself from fapping this day. You feel like your finaly can do it. You
even was without fapping for several days.

And you are reading some boring local news. And then your eyes cathces fancy
image of advertisment on a side of a webpage. Then you click it. Then you
catches an image of a girl on another page. It leads you to see through images
of other girl on the page. You start feeling increase of UF. Five minutes after
you start fapping.

How does it happened? Why you wasn't interested in that image on the side of the
page yesterday? And how I can be sure that tommorow another image or any other
trigger won't lead me to fapping?

In this guide I use following model of mental anchors.

There are lots of mental anchors around us. Some of them lead to fap most of them
don't. Our mind constantly leaps from one anchor to another. All the trigers can
form countless chains of mind wandering behaviour.

We can read this guide now. A second later we can think of an important task we
was wanted to do. It leads us to think of all those bad consecvenses if we won't
finish the task. Than we think about meaningless of our live. It leads us to
think of the universe itself. Then we remember to read this guide. And so on,
and so forth

It is impossible to predict what chain of all countless possabilities would use
our mind to wander.

Among all possible chains there is some chain that will lead us to eventual fap.
If our monkey mind will deside to leap on one of them we would enetually fap. If
it will not - then today is a happy day for us.

With increasing of our SD increases probability of our monkey mind to choose
fapping chain of trigers.

Is there a way to understand if we are on a fapping chain now? Yes! When we are
on a fapping chain we feel noticible increase of UF. Not as high as it is almost
irresistable. But noticiblaly high. If we will keep being on that fapping chain
it will almost inevitable lead as to fap. But if we change our chain of trigers
and leap to another - we may escape.
